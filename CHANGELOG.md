# Changelog

All notable changes to dev-guardian are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). From 1.0.0 the MCP tool/resource
surface and default behaviours follow semver — breaking changes require a major
version bump.

## [1.1.3] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **MCP server now starts on a fresh install — no `npm install` required.** The
  server imported `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `better-sqlite3`, `execa` and
  `zod` as runtime dependencies, but the plugin ships git-first with
  `mcp/node_modules` git-ignored, so the *installed* server crashed on its first
  import with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and none of the 50 MCP tools came up (the
  zero-dependency hooks were unaffected).
  - Replaced the native **`better-sqlite3`** engine with the built-in
    **`node:sqlite`** (`DatabaseSync`), behind a thin adapter in
    `mcp/src/storage/db.ts` (`prepare/run/get/all/exec/pragma` + a nesting-aware
    `transaction`) — no native module to compile or ship.
  - The build now **bundles** `dist/server.js` with esbuild
    (`mcp/scripts/bundle.mjs`), inlining the remaining pure-JS deps, so the
    server runs with **zero** runtime `node_modules`.
  - The server is launched with `--experimental-sqlite` and now requires Node
    **>=22.5**. No change to the MCP tool/resource surface (still 50 tools,
    16 resources); the full test suite now exercises the `node:sqlite` engine.

### Changed

- Removed `better-sqlite3` / `@types/better-sqlite3`; bumped `@types/node` to
  22.x and added `esbuild` as the bundler. Verified the bundled server boots
  from a `node_modules`-free sandbox and lists all 50 tools.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **MCP server now loads when the plugin is enabled.** The plugin manifest
  (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) launched the server via the invalid
  `${pluginDir}` placeholder, which Claude Code does not recognise — it rejected
  the config with `Invalid MCP server config for "dev-guardian": Missing
  environment variables: pluginDir` and the 51 MCP tools never came up. Switched
  to the documented **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`** placeholder (already used by the
  guardrail hooks). Same fix applied to the docs that quoted the old form
  (`README.md`, `mcp/README.md`, `mcp/src/hostsetup/mcpConfig.ts`). No change to
  the MCP tool/resource surface or plugin behaviour.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-07

### Changed

- **Dropped the GitHub Actions CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
  dev-guardian is distributed git-first and the maintainer avoids the recurring
  Actions cost, so the quality gates now run **locally**: `npm test`,
  `npm run build` (rebuild `mcp/dist/` before committing — no CI to catch
  drift), markdownlint, the guardrail hooks, and the `dev-guardian check` CLI.
  No npm publishing either (unchanged — never set up). No change to the plugin
  behaviour or the MCP tool/resource surface.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Guardrail hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json` + `hooks/guardian-hook.mjs`),
  auto-loaded when the plugin is enabled — **dependency-free** (only `node:`
  builtins + pure compiled detectors; no native modules, so they run in the
  installed plugin where `mcp/node_modules` isn't shipped) and **fail-open**
  (any error → exit 0, never breaks the host):
  - **SessionStart** — briefs the agent with the project's security posture
    (branch, uncommitted changes, last-scan age, init state).
  - **PostToolUse (Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit)** — warns, with a
    **redacted** preview, when freshly written text contains a hard-coded
    secret. The authoritative full scan stays `scan_secrets` (gitleaks).
  - **PreToolUse (Bash)** — denies catastrophic commands by default
    (`rm -rf /`, `curl … | sh`, raw-disk `dd`/`mkfs`, fork bombs); warns on
    risky ones (force-push, hard reset, `sudo`, `chmod 777`).
  - Configurable via `.guardian/hooks.config.json` (opt-in secret-write
    blocking with `secrets.block`), `.guardian/hooks-allowlist.json` for false
    positives, and the `GUARDIAN_HOOKS=off` kill switch.
- `mcp/src/hooks/secretScan.ts` + `bashGuard.ts` — pure, unit-tested detection
  engines (31 new tests) shared by the hooks and the CLI.
- `dev-guardian check` CLI subcommand (`--file <path>` / `--bash "<command>"`,
  `--min`, `--json`) — run the same guardrail detectors from a terminal or CI;
  exit code 1 on a finding.

### Fixed

- The MCP server no longer reports a hard-coded `0.1.0`; it reads its version
  from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at startup (falling back to the MCP
  `package.json`), keeping its reported identity in lock-step with the release.
- `mcp/package.json` version aligned with the plugin release (was stale at
  `0.1.0`).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-05

First stable release. Everything below was already shipped in 0.x; 1.0.0 marks
the point where the surface is proven and held to semver.

### Added

- **CI pipeline** (GitHub Actions): markdownlint; build + test on Linux, macOS
  and Windows; a dist-sync gate (committed `mcp/dist` must equal a fresh build);
  coverage thresholds; an e2e job running real Semgrep against a vulnerable
  fixture; and a dogfood self-audit (Syft SBOM + gitleaks + Semgrep SARIF).
- **Stability snapshot** — the exact 50 tools + 16 resources are pinned in
  `toolSurface.test.ts`; accidental surface drift fails CI.
- `SECURITY.md` (responsible disclosure), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, this `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- **First stable release.** The MCP tool/resource surface and default
  behaviours are now covered by semver.

### Fixed

- README counts corrected (44 commands, 16 resources).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- `mcp-config` CLI (`bin/dev-guardian.mjs`) — bootstrap dev-guardian into any AI
  host from a plain terminal, with the absolute server path filled in. Prints a
  paste-ready block or, with `--write`, merges it into the project.
- `mcp/src/hostsetup/setup.ts` — context-free host-setup core (`setupHost`,
  `previewMcpConfig`) shared by the CLI.

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** the `install_host_context` MCP tool. Use the `mcp-config` CLI
  instead. MCP tool count: 51 → 50.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- In-repo AI host configs (dogfooding): `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`,
  `.vscode/`, `.windsurf/`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, root `AGENTS.md`
  / `GEMINI.md`, and a `CLAUDE.md` contributor guide. Open the repo in any host
  and the MCP server + rules load out of the box (relative paths).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- Branded Pro Digital Key HTML reports for `report_export` and
  `/guardian-report`: a self-contained shell with a dark/light toggle (system
  default, persisted), 100% offline, print-friendly, and trilingual chrome via
  a `lang` input.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `report_export` default format changed from `html` to
  `markdown`. `html` / `sarif` / `json` remain available explicitly.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added

- Multi-host MCP installer: register the server (merging, never clobbering) plus
  the rules file across Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Cline, Codex CLI,
  Gemini CLI and Claude Desktop. Adds a `GEMINI.md` rules template.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- `scan_skill` — vet a third-party skill / MCP server / agent before install
  (16 threat categories, YARA-style signatures, taint-light, OSV.dev lookups,
  0–100 risk score).

### Fixed

- Ship the compiled `mcp/dist/` so the plugin's MCP server starts without an
  install-time build.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- MCP server startup.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added

- First public release: open-source security / bugfix / quality / deps /
  observability / performance / compliance plugin with an MCP server, SQLite
  state, and trilingual (EN/PT/ES) triggers.
